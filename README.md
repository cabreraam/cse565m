# Acceleration of Algorithms in<br />Reconfigurable Logic

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }
Washington University in St. Louis<br />
Fall 2024

Welcome! This is a graduate level CSE course that introduces the design of hardware accelerators for a specific application or class of applications.
In this class, we will use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as the medium for our hardware designs, and we will use high-level synthesis (HLS) -- in contrast to low-level RTL -- to author the designs.
The goals of the class are to
- take applications of interest from algorithm to hardware design
- develop intuition for performant hardware architectures designed using HLS
- learn the fundamentals of the state of the art (SOTA) tooling for HLS

Just the Class is a template that extends the popular [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme, which provides a robust and thoroughly-tested foundation for your website. Just the Docs include features such as:

- automatic [navigation structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/),
- instant, full-text [search](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/search/) and page indexing,
- and a set of [UI components](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) and authoring [utilities](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/utilities).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Just the Class is simple.

1. Create a [new repository based on Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class/generate).
1. Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with your course information. [Be sure to update the url and baseurl](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/).
1. Configure a [publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages). Your course website is now live!
1. Edit and create `.md` [Markdown files](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add more content pages.

Just the Class has been used by instructors at Stanford University ([CS 161](https://stanford-cs161.github.io/winter2021/)), UC Berkeley ([Data 100](https://ds100.org/fa21/)), UC Santa Barbara ([CSW8](https://ucsb-csw8.github.io/s22/)), Northeastern University ([CS4530/5500](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-CS5500-Spring-2021/)), and Carnegie Mellon University ([17-450/17-950](https://cmu-crafting-software.github.io/)).

### Local development environment

Just the Class requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler. To setup a local development environment, clone your template repository and follow the GitHub Docs on [Testing your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

%<button class="btn js-toggle-dark-mode">Preview dark color scheme</button>
%
%<script>
%const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode');
%
%jtd.addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function(){
%  if (jtd.getTheme() === 'dark') {
%    jtd.setTheme('light');
%    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'dark color scheme';
%  } else {
%    jtd.setTheme('dark');
%    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Return to the light side';
%  }
%});
%</script>
