: [No class; work on Final Project Ideas](#)
  : [](#)
: A good use of time would be to
  + start mapping out your final project proposal
  + start thinking about final project ideas
    + note that you don't have to roll entirely new projects from scratch
    + Search ["hls fpga"](https://github.com/search?q=hls%20fpga&type=repositories) or ["hls fpga vitis"](https://github.com/search?q=hls+fpga+vitis&type=repositories) for ideas
    + perfectly fine to augment existing projects for your own purposes
    + also fine to start from scratch
    + use [Vitis Libraries](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Libraries/tree/2023.1) as inspiration
        + note that I've linked the `2023.1` branch
  + start thinking about how you'll create your final poster
    + [potential template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J6rQtA95_g-rEl-WLKhItFrUferanWS7vdaJzTB45rM/edit#slide=id.p3)
