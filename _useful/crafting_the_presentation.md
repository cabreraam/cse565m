# Crafting the Presentation

## Logistics
This document should serve as a guide for when you create your presentation.

Your presentation slot will be 20 minutes total:
+ 15 minutes for content
+ 5 minutes for questions from the audience

Note that you need to be able to effectively cover this paper in __15 minutes__.
This means that you must distill the content of the paper into a form that you can present within the time allotted.
When giving presentations at academic venues, work, etc., it is important to respect the amount of time you are given, i.e., __don't go over time__.
I will give you warnings for when 5, 10, 12, and 14 minutes have passed in order to help you keep your presentation on track.

> __WARNING__:
> However, I will unceremoniously usher you to finish your presentation for the sake of keeping our schedule.
> And I _will_ notice if you start rushing through your slides in order to get through your content, and that will adversely affect your grade.

## How to Craft Your Presentation
### Read the Paper
Especially if the paper you're reading is outside your area of expertise, it can be helpful to have a strategy for reading the paper.

For example, I like to read the abstract, introduction, and then conclusion.
This gives me an idea of the high-level ideas of the paper, e.g., what problem are they trying to solve, how they solved it, and what metrics they used to compare their work to the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Then, I'll skim the paper in its entirety.
Often, I get bogged down into every last detail when I read scientific material;
to combat this when reading papers, I'll tell myself to read the entire paper and only let myself spend a few minutes on something I may not understand upon first read.
I do make a note of such points in the paper so that I can revisit them in a future read of the paper.
(Additionally, sometimes the information or extra context I needed to understand the paper just happened to be a sentence or two _after_ the sentence I was stuck on!)
This skimming of the paper gives a little more specific insight into the motivation of the problem and how they solved the problem they present.

Finally, I do a much more fine-grained reading of the paper and let myself sit with pencil and paper, working out any mathematical formalisms, filling in missing parts of a derivation, sketching any drawings, etc.
Whatever I need to do in order to try to understand the prose.

### Reflect on what you read
+ What was the paper about?
+ What problem were they trying to solve?
+ Did they convince you that they did a good job?
  + Why or why not?
+ What were the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?
+ What, if anything, would you have done differently?
  + Often this is a good question to ask when you are
    + looking to expand upon the work
    + doing a literature review for on-going research and point out deficiencies that you address in your own efforts

### Elements of a successful presentation
+ Conveying the problem the authors are trying to solve
+ Understanding the motivation well enough to relay that to the class
+ Effectively contextualize the work
  + use the related work and background sections that papers often use to do this very thing
+ Guide us through the methods/experimental design used to solve the presented problem(s)
+ Show the results and tell us how they reflect they reflect the methods and experimental design
+ Conclude by giving us a recap of the paper and your general opinions
